Welcome to your night job. Here are some tips for your job.

The monkey likes to move around. He can wander to and enter the door to your office. You can use door light to check if he is about to enter. If he is there close door to keep him out.

The elephant seems attracted to your office. They also enter by the door. The light on the door they use doesn't work so keep an eye on those cameras. Just close the door to keep them out.

The deer come apart really easily. She moves parts into office, though the vents. If you see a part of her in the vent press the shock button to move her back to the stage. If you are unable to shock her, she will enter the office. If she gets her parts in your office, she might attack.

Also the doors to your office will open after 13 seconds to conserve power.

Good Luck,
[COMPANY]"
